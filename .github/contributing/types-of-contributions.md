# Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to the GitHub Docs content and site in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on docs.github.com! Our small, but mighty :muscle: docs team is maintaining this repo, to preserve our bandwidth, off topic conversations will be closed.

### :mega: Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions]([https://github.com/github/docs/discussions](https://github.com/seraph776/QuickStartTemplate)).

### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues]([https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues](https://github.com/seraph776/QuickStartTemplate/issues)) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://github.com/seraph776/QuickStartTemplate/pulls) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa:



### :question: Support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with GitHub, unrelated to our documentation, please [contact QuickStartTemplate Support directly](https://github.com/seraph776/QuickStartTemplate/blob/main/SUPPORT.md). Any issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.



**We do not currently accept contributions for translated content**, but we hope to in the future.

### :balance_scale: Site Policy
GitHub's site policies are published on docs.github.com, too!

If you find a typo in the site policy section, you can open a pull request to fix it. For anything else, see [the CONTRIBUTING guide in the site-policy repo](https://github.com/seraph776/QuickStartTemplate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
