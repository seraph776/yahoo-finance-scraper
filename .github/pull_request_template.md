## Self review checklist

Please review your Pull Request before submission.


- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected. This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems. Remember that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar or spelling.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.
